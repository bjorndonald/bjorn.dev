At the end of last year, I received adverse news that significantly disrupted my work as a programmer for several months. Consequently, I took an extended hiatus from coding. During this period, I engaged in a thorough reflection on my professional identity as a developer. This introspection revealed that I had lost my enjoyment of coding for some time.\"}),\"\\n\",n(t.p,{children:\"I decided to use this period to rekindle my passion for programming, as I remain committed to pursuing it as a long-term career. To achieve this, I took a step back from my usual programming activities and frameworks.

This practical need led me to focus on learning skills that would enhance my job prospects, particularly JavaScript and web development. Eventually, like many others, I discovered ReactJS.
