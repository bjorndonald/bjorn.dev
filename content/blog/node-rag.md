# Supercharging Retrieval-Augmented Generation with NodeRAG: A Graph-Centric Approach

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** continue to break new ground in complex reasoning tasks. It often feels like a new frontier model tops the leaderboard for reasoning benchmarks every other week. A major contributor to these advancements is the evolution of **retrieval mechanisms**‚Äîparticularly those powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

First introduced by the **Meta AI team** ([Lewis et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)), RAG was designed to improve factual consistency in language model outputs by accessing external corpora during inference. This allows models to deliver more domain-specific, up-to-date, and grounded responses.

Today, tech giants like Google and OpenAI implement RAG differently:

* **Google‚Äôs Vertex AI Search** combines semantic and keyword (hybrid) search with a re-ranking mechanism to serve the most relevant results.
* **OpenAI**, on the other hand, embeds RAG directly into the model's runtime when tools and file uploads are enabled. Additionally, OpenAI orchestrates tool usage intelligently with its **Responses API**.

However, for independent developers and smaller teams, replicating this level of RAG infrastructure is costly. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial to explore **open-source innovations** that democratize access to advanced RAG capabilities.

Enter **NodeRAG**: a powerful, graph-based RAG framework designed to optimize retrieval by leveraging heterogeneous graph structures.

## What Is NodeRAG?

NodeRAG is a **graph-centric RAG framework** designed to address limitations in traditional RAG systems, especially when dealing with **multi-hop reasoning** and **summary-level queries**.

While earlier graph-based RAG methods showed promise, they often overlooked the **design of the graph structure itself**. NodeRAG changes that by deeply integrating graph methodologies throughout the indexing and searching process.

At its core, NodeRAG builds a **heterograph**‚Äîa graph made up of different node types, including:

* **Entities (N)**
* **Relationships (R)**
* **Semantic Units (S)**
* **Attributes (A)**
* **High-level Elements (H)**
* **Overviews (O)**
* **Text Chunks (T)**

These nodes form a richly connected structure that encapsulates, summarizes, and enhances the original corpus‚Äîleading to **fine-grained**, **context-aware**, and **explainable retrieval**.

## NodeRAG Pipeline: From Corpus to Graph

The NodeRAG pipeline is split into two main phases: **graph indexing** and **graph searching**.

### 1. Graph Indexing

This phase constructs the heterograph and enriches it with multiple layers of semantic information.

#### a. Graph Decomposition

Text is broken down using an LLM into:

* **Semantic Units (S)**: Paraphrased summaries of local events or ideas.
* **Entities (N)**: Named objects or people.
* **Relationships (R)**: Links connecting entities to semantic units.

#### b. Graph Augmentation

Next, graph algorithms identify **key nodes and communities**:

* **Attributes (A)** are extracted via LLM summarization of entities and relationships.
* **High-level Elements (H)** are distilled summaries of community-level meaning.
* **Overviews (O)** serve as keyword-based titles for high-level elements.

This step also segments the graph into **communities** using the **Leiden algorithm** (Traag et al., 2019), preserving structural coherence.

#### c. Graph Enrichment

Original text chunks are embedded to retain full context and improve relevance. Only a **subset** is embedded to optimize for storage and efficiency.

---

### 2. Graph Searching

When a query is made, NodeRAG performs a dual-layered retrieval process:

#### a. Dual Search

* **Title-based exact match**
* **Vector-based semantic match**

#### b. Personalized PageRank (PPR)

Starting from entry nodes, a **shallow PPR algorithm** conducts a localized random walk to surface **multi-hop reasoning paths**, without excessive noise.

#### c. Final Filtering

Irrelevant or low-value nodes (e.g., keyword-only nodes) are excluded, ensuring a **refined and targeted retrieval set**.

## Evaluation & Benchmarks

NodeRAG has been benchmarked against NaiveRAG, GraphRAG, and LightRAG using datasets like **HotpotQA**, **MuSiQue**, and **RAG-QA Arena**.

### Key Results:

* **MuSiQue**: NodeRAG achieved **46.29% accuracy**, outperforming GraphRAG (41.71%) and LightRAG (36.00%).
* **HotpotQA**: NodeRAG delivered comparable accuracy to GraphRAG (89.5% vs 89.0%) **with 1.6k fewer retrieved tokens**.
* **RAG-QA Arena (Lifestyle domain)**: NodeRAG achieved a **94.9% retrieval ratio**, compared to GraphRAG‚Äôs 86.3% and LightRAG‚Äôs 81.7%, with fewer tokens.

These results highlight NodeRAG‚Äôs superior **efficiency and accuracy**, especially in **multi-hop** and **summary-based QA**.

## Getting Started with NodeRAG

### üîß Requirements

* Python
* Sample `.txt`, `.md`, or `.doc` files
* Anaconda or `uv` for dependency management
* OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini recommended)

### üß™ Setup & Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Terry-Xu-666/NodeRAG.git
cd NodeRAG
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment

**With Conda:**

```bash
conda create -n NodeRAG python=3.10
conda activate NodeRAG
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**With uv (faster):**

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Prepare your files

Create a project folder with an `input/` directory. Add your documents there.

#### 4. Configure NodeRAG

```bash
python -m NodeRAG.build -f path/to/project_folder
```

Edit the `Node_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
model_config:
  model_name: gpt-4o-mini
  api_keys: YOUR_API_KEY

embedding_config:
  api_keys: YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### 5. Build the graph

```bash
python -m NodeRAG.build -f path/to/project_folder
```

#### 6. Run Queries

Create a `main.py` file:

```python
from NodeRAG import NodeConfig, NodeSearch

config = NodeConfig.from_main_folder("/path/to/project")
search = NodeSearch(config)

ans = search.answer("Create a multiple choice question based on my resume.")
print(ans)
```

## üîç Visualizing the Graph

Generate an HTML graph with:

```bash
python -m NodeRAG.Vis.html -f path/to/project_folder -n 600
```

This will produce an `index.html` file you can open in a browser to view a compact visual of your heterograph.

---

## Conclusion

NodeRAG brings a fresh, **graph-driven perspective to RAG** by integrating semantic, structural, and contextual layers into a single heterograph. Its **fine-grained decomposition**, **explainability**, and **retrieval efficiency** make it a compelling tool for anyone building advanced AI systems without enterprise-level infrastructure.

Whether you're building a personal assistant, a document search engine, or an AI tutor, **NodeRAG allows you to create a domain-aware, multi-hop capable retrieval engine‚Äîwithout breaking the bank**.
